To match borrowers and investors, we use our custom business logic engine, with Auto-match™ and Auto-diversify™ algorithms. We operate in a high-volume low-margin business, building scalable and secure internet platforms, targeting multiple markets. Due to huge data volumes, we use in-house machine learning and AI for data analysis, and constantly monitor innovations in the data-analytics space.

We have an in-house development team. We don't do off-shore development, but we might also collaborate with other talented individuals. We support a lot of open source development.

The company is polyglot with multiple different programming languages, but our main focus has been on functional programming and the finance-industry battle-tested Microsoft .NET architecture.

Function composition architecture and immutable design by default has enabled us to create highly maintainable solutions, focusing more on the development of new features, rather than having to focus on fixing existing issues. We use an information-rich programming language: type providers enable the rapid development of communications with many external systems.

On the user interface side we've always used lot of different technologies to explore the latest innovations, mainly responsive layout design and occasionally real-time communication channels.

This relatively small company is cloud-native with an infrastructure-as-code architecture, but not solely dependent on a single cloud-provider.
